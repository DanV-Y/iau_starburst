Synthetic column densities and velocity spectra of selected ions.

This repo is organized as follows:
1. `ion_column_densities`: column densities for each of the ions presented below.
2. `ndensity`: column density of the system.
3. `spectra`: velocity spectra of each of the ions presented below.

## GUIDE TO SYNTHETIC COLUMN DENSITIES
PNG figures for ions C II, C IV, Fe II, H I, Mg I, Mg II, N I, N V, O I, O VI, S II, Si II, Si IV.

Snapshots are taken at 0.2, 1.2, 2.2 and 3.2 Myr.

## GUIDE TO SPECTRA
PNG figures ions C II, C IV, Fe II, H I, Mg I, Mg II, N I, N V, O I, O VI, S II, Si II, Si IV at time 2.2 Myr.

Different rays were traced through the wind-cloud system to account for different configurations of the system with respect to the radiation source.

- **RAY 1:** going along the y-axis through the center of the system.
- **RAY 2:** going along the y-axis, 5 pc off the centre in the x-z plane.
- **RAY 3:** going along the y-axis, 15 pc off the centre in the x-z plane.
- **RAY 4:** going along the x-axis through the center of the system.
- **RAY 5:** going along the x-axis, 5 pc off the centre in the y-z plane.
- **RAY 6:** going along the x-axis, 15 pc off the centre in the y-z plane.
